# TOPDER - Platform for Ordering Tables and Food  

TOPDER is an innovative platform that connects customers with restaurants through three main portals: **Customer Portal**, **Restaurant Portal**, and **Admin Portal**. Customers can search for restaurants, read blogs, manage wallets, and place orders. Restaurants have a dedicated dashboard to manage menus, orders, tables, vouchers, and advertisements. Meanwhile, admins oversee platform operations, including discount rates, advertisement pricing, and system analytics. By combining advanced technology with practical features, TOPDER enhances operational efficiency for businesses and improves the dining experience for customers.
